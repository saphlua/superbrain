# superbrain

Superbrain is a brainf*** interpreter with optional extras.

Brainf*** uses eight characters to write incredibly simple instructions. It is Turing-complete.

Information is stored on a 'tape' which is either finite (usually 30000 cells) or infinite. A pointer is pushed back and forth along the tape, reading and writing values. A simple loop block can be used to repeat instructions based on a condition.


| Instruction | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `>` | 

The augmented version supplied here contains eight extra characters.
